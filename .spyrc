# Sample spy configuration file
#
# Any line which has a '#' as the first non-whitespace character is
# considered to be a comment.  If the '#' symbol occurs anywhere else
# on the line, it is interpreted literally (i.e. it is not a comment).
#

#
#  Change the beep (which is quite loud and annoying under NT)
#
#beep aplay $HFS/houdini/config/Audio/Oops.aiff

#
#  To have spy not complain that you have to hit enter to continue after every
#  command, uncomment the following line.
#
relaxprompt

#
#  To allow "relaxed" searching (i.e. searching for a string anywhere in a file
#  instead of searching from the beginning of the filename), uncomment the
#  following line.
#
relaxsearch

#
#  relaxcase will make sorting case insensitive, while norelaxcase will make
#  sorting case sensitive.  The default value depends on your operating system,
#  but it can be changed if you choose.
#
#norelaxcase
relaxcase

#
#  If the shell that you use doesn't support window titling in the way spy
#  expects, you should comment this out.

#  Here are some example key mappings

#map < unix_cmd	:?

#
#  Spy has the ability to hide files from the display, this makes the display
#  cleaner and hides junk - showing only the interesting files.  Here are some
#  possible masks which can be used (or not).

#
#  Ignore mask 1 -- show only maya files
#
ignoremask *.animation_clip.tft 1
ignoremask *.gr2 1
ignoremask *.properties.tft 1

#
#  Ignore mask 2 - show only animation clips
#
ignoremask *.gr2 2
ignoremask *.ma 2
ignoremask *.properties.tft 2

#
#  Ignore mask 3 - show only granny files
#
ignoremask *.ma 3
ignoremask *.animation_clip.tft 3
ignoremask *.properties.tft 3

#
#  Specify which ignore masks are implemented on start up.  Specifying a value
#  of 1 (second number) will turn the mask on by default.

#ignoredefault 1 1
#ignoredefault 2 1
ignoredefault 1 0
ignoredefault 2 0
ignoredefault 3 0

#  It is also possible to map keys to toggle the ignore mask on and off.
map <F9>  ignoretoggle =1
map <F10> ignoretoggle =2
map <F11> ignoretoggle =3

#
# Spy can also color code filenames (except when running rlogged in).  The
# colors can be chosen from:
#	red, black, white, cyan, blue, purple, green or yellow
# These colors can also be prefixed with:
#	reverse_, underline_
#
# There are also some special patterns recognized:
#	-dir	Directory
#	-x	Executable file
#	-tagged	All tagged files
#
color -dir  yellow 
color -x    underline_green
color -tagged underline_green
color core   blue
color core.*   blue
color vgcore.*   blue
color *.h	purple	
color *.cpp	cyan
color *.animation_clip.tft	white
color *.ma			yellow
color *.gr2			red
color *.properties.tft		purple

# Map a key to turn colors on and off
map C colortoggle
